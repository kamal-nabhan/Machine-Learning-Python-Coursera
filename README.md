# Machine-Learning-Python-Coursera

## Introduction

This repository provides Python versions of the programming assignments for Professor Andrew Ng's Machine Learning online class. This is maybe the most popular basic online machine learning course. It is not only popular, but it is also one of the best Machine Learning courses that any interested student may take to really get started with machine learning. The programming exercises in this class are in MATLAB or OCTAVE, which is problematic since this class was created before Python became the go-to choice in machine learning.

The Python machine learning environment has evolved rapidly in recent years and is still gaining traction. I believe that many students who wish to begin their machine learning adventure will do it with Python as well. For these reasons, I've chosen to rewrite all of the programming tasks in Python.

## Requirements

These assignments has been tested and developed using the following libraries: 

    - python==3.6.4
    - numpy==1.13.3
    - scipy==1.0.0
    - matplotlib==2.1.2
